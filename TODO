âˆš give rooms a name 
    - and let people change them
- require handles (or auto-generate anon-y handles)
- persist handles, let people change them
- work on ui/ux a bit
    - can we get a slack-ish layout, with chat at the bottom?
    - list of people who are "here"?
- include old-school django POST view?
    might make a good flow for the article, start with old-style and then add WSS
